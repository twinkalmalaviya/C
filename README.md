C question practice:

1. Write your own strcpy function:
   Details of used directives:
   a) Six directives are available to control conditional compilation. They delimit blocks of program text that are compiled only if a
       specified condition is true. These directives can be nested. The program text within the blocks is arbitrary and may consist of
       preprocessor directives, C statements, and so on. The beginning of the block of program text is marked by one of three directives:
   b) If the condition checked by #if , #ifdef , or #ifndef is true (nonzero), then all lines between the matching #else (or #elif ) and         an #endif directive, if present, are ignored.
   c) If the condition is false (0), then the lines between the #if , #ifdef , or #ifndef and an #else , #elif , or #endif directive are         ignored.
   following are the directives:
    #if
    #ifdef
    #ifndef
    Optionally, an alternative block of text can be set aside with one of two directives:
    #else
    #elif
    The end of the block or alternative block is marked by the #endif directive.
